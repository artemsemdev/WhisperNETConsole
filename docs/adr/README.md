# Architecture Decision Records

VoxFlow maintains architecture decision records (ADRs) as part of the architecture documentation.

## Where ADRs Live

Legacy ADRs are maintained in the monolithic decision log:

**[docs/architecture/06-decision-log.md](../architecture/06-decision-log.md)**

That log contains ADR-001 through ADR-023, covering decisions from the initial console architecture through the multi-host Core extraction and Desktop app.

New ADRs may also be added as standalone files in `docs/adr/` when a separate reviewable document is preferable.

## ADR Format

Each record includes:

- **Status** — Accepted or Superseded (with a pointer to the superseding ADR)
- **Context** — The situation that motivated the decision
- **Decision** — What was decided
- **Alternatives considered** — Options evaluated and why they were rejected
- **Trade-offs accepted** — Consequences acknowledged at decision time
